# Things to do before we can go live

* Get rid of the .html filenames
    * others.html should be /others/
* Stylized blockquote
* padding/margin issues with headers and body content.
* fix w3.org validation errors
* testimonial CSS Tweaks
* change a:hover background from rgba to hex
* On the testimonials page, link to the installation page inline from the quotes.  And any other relevant.
* Give props to designer dude and Jeana, along with links back to respective homepages.

# Maybe things

* Add sidebars to inside pages.  Maybe the Testimonials page has a sidebar link to Installation, for example.
* Link to my blog and/or my book.  I have a huge amount of traffic coming to btg.com, and I should take advantage of it.

# Missing from the old page
* Link to Changelog
