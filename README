This is the source code for the website http://betterthangrep.com

I want to make an overhaul of the site.  The front page is drab and
boring and you can't find anything.

The major sections I'd like to have from the front are:

* Front page
    * Screenshots (That I don't have yet)
    * How to install + ack for Textmate users

* Testimonials

* Top 10 reasons to use ack

* Ack's command flags

* Ack's recognized filetypes

* Other tools (see below)

I figure each of those can be a differnet page, with five different tabs on the front.


The "Other tools" is going to be a page about other ack-like tools.
I don't have any content for that page, so we don't have to create
the page.  Just know that we need to account for it.
