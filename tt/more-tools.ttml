    <h1>Tools that work with ack</h1>

    <h2>AckMate</h2>

    <p>
    Users of <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, the
    programmer's editor for the Mac, can use the AckMate plugin by
    Trevor Squires:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        TextMate users know just how slow its "Find in Project"
        can be with large source trees. That's why you need
        "ack-in-project" &mdash; a TextMate bundle that uses
        the super-speedy "ack" tool to search your code
        FAST. It gives you beautiful, clickable results just
        as fast as "ack" can find them. Check it out at:

    <h1>Alternatives to ack</h1>

    <p>
    There are many ways to search source code that are more flexible
    and tuned to programmers than straight <code>grep</code>.  I
    suggest you take a look at some of these alternatives, for they
    may suit your needs better than ack.  If you have any suggestions
    to add to this list, please let me know at
